        <h2 class="section-title">The Man Who Inspired a Nation</h2>
        <p>
            Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, affectionately known as the "People's President," was born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. Coming from a humble background, young Kalam sold newspapers to support his family's income, never imagining that one day he would become one of India's most revered scientists and leaders.
        </p>
        <p>
            His journey from the small town of Rameswaram to the Rashtrapati Bhavan is nothing short of extraordinary. Dr. Kalam graduated in physics from St. Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, and later studied aerospace engineering at the Madras Institute of Technology. His dedication to science and technology, coupled with an unwavering commitment to national development, made him a pioneer in India's space and missile programs.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a scientist, he worked with DRDO and ISRO, playing a pivotal role in India's civilian space program and military missile development. His work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology earned him the title "Missile Man of India." The successful Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998 established India as a nuclear weapons state, with Dr. Kalam playing a crucial technological and political role.
